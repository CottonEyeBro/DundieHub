# DundieHub
Final capstone project for my Flatiron School Full-Stack software engineering certification. Utilizes Flask, SQLAlchemy, React.js, and CSS to build a generic social media-clone for the cast of The Office.

# Getting Started
Follow these simple steps to get started with DundieHub:

Clone the Repository: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

$ git clone git@github.com:CottonEyeBro/DundieHub.git


open a Terminal and type the following in order:

# Running the Server
1. $ pipenv install && pipenv shell --- this command is to create the virtual environment
2. $ cd server
3. $ export FLASK_APP=app.py
4. $ python app.py --- to get the program started once in the shell environment
5. Open a second terminal and cd out of server into the DundieHub directory
